react-qrsvg
===========

Render a QR code into an SVG.

Usage:

```js
import QrSvg from 'react-qrsvg';

<QrSvg>Hello World!</QrSvg>
```

Todo
----

- More customization of QR code (fill color, etc.)
- Encoding a string as a QR code is slow. Are there libraries we could use that
  do it asynchronously?
